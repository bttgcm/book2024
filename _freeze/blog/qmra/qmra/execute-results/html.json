What we tried to quantify is the risk that consumer and workers would face while using wastewater sludge as a fertiliser. The numercial models that we built suggest that there is significant risk for both categories but also that other source of microbial contamination exist. We are now working on a policy briefing that will give suggestions on how to better address this issue in Uganda.\n\n[Read the full article](https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/23915/1/butte_g_et_al_210527.pdf) or listen to an episode of [Paper to Practice](https://anchor.fm/paperstopractice/episodes/Episode-2-Microbial-Risk-of-Fecal-Sludge-Use-in-Ugandan-Agriculture-e11mfg1/a-a6p39s2).\n\n\n",
