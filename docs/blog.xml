  <title>Using codes for notetaking in Zotero</title>
  <link>https://www.giacomobutte.com/blog/zotero/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>When doing a literature review on a given topic, I would find very useful to create codes for a specific sub-topic and then tag the relevant notes or quotes from the articles with the specific code. In this way it is very fast and precise to pinpoint all the relevant information.This is a very similar process as coding in qualitative analysis. At the end I would ideally have a list of notes with links to the articles, as well with tags associated. I have not found a way to do it but this wordkflow gets rather close to it.</p>

<p>Finding an academic journal for publication it is not a linear process. Here some notes I have taken for different methods can be used. As an example I will use my search related to a recent research done at ICIMOD with the following abstract and keywords:</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-simple callout-note no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Natural springs are the main water source for the 13 million people living in the midhills of Himalaya. These sources have been under stress due to numerous factors, such as climate change, infrastructural development, and socio-economic changes. To combat this trend, spring revival activities have been carried out across the Hindu Kush Himalaya in the last few years. Considering two study sites in Nepal, this work attempts the frst costbeneft analysis for spring revival in rural settings. Firstly, using literature and community consultations, we drafted a cause-eﬀect map. Secondly, we quantitatively estimate the costs and benefts using four scenarios: two based on the study sites and two on more generic situations. Positive (&gt;1) beneft-cost ratios were found in three scenarios, showing that spring revival has potential but local conditions (household served, presence of other water sources, usage) are important factors to be considered.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="semantic-network">Semantic network</h2>
<p>In an article on Water Security(WS) <sup>1</sup> we tried to find a way to compare different definition for the concept and to break down these definitions in parts for comparison. The result is something fairly close to semantic network <sup>2</sup>. From the image below one can see for example how the basic meaning is defined differently. looking at L2 and L3 in the image below, it can be observed that the majority of definitions see WS as “access / availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality”. Other definitions frame it using risk concepts and define it as “acceptable risk level / protection from diseases and disasters”. L4 defines the systems that are supported by WS: most mentioned are a health life and ecosystems, followed by economic aspects (livelihood and production). Lastly L5 indicates other limits that should be considered such as sustainability, geographical limitations, costs.</p>

This is often used as a form of knowledge representation. It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices, which represent concepts, and edges, which represent semantic relations between concepts,[1] mapping or connecting semantic fields. A semantic network may be instantiated as, for example, a graph database or a concept map. Typical standardized semantic networks are expressed as semantic triples.(Wikipedia)</p></div></div><p><img src="https://www.giacomobutte.com/blog/visuals/water_security.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

<p>When working at Newcastle University on Water Security, I felt the complexity of that concept could be reduced to a simpler form taking inspiration from system diagrams. The idea was to place 3 elements at the center of the diagram. Nature(N), Population (P) mediated by infrastructure (I). Additionally these 3 elements would have close relation to enabling factors such as governance (G) and resources (R). This part of the diagram represent the system at a local level. This can be thought as a region, village, basin, it would depend on local conditions.</p>
<p>This “local system” would then have external stressors such as climate change (CC), political change (PL), growth (GU) and economic changes (EC).</p>

<p>What is perhaps more interesting is that the relation between these nodes can describe particular situations. For example, nature-population (N-P) represent natural hazards on one way and human threat to the natural environment. Resources given to infrastructure is described by R-I. User behaviours between population and infrastructure (P-I).</p>

<p>To test the diagram, I associated the Sustainable Development Goals with each section of the diagram:</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>With colleagues fro the <a href="https://www.watersecurityhub.org">Water Security Hub</a> we wrote an article that proposes a framework for organizing data collection for Water Security. Within the vast spectrum of definitions and concepts that already exist, we suggest a methodology to guide practitioners through this complexity.</p>

  <title>A short exploration on air quality monitoring</title>

<p>I have been exploring about air quality using the Temptop M2000 2nd Generation to <a href="https://observablehq.com/@bttgcm/office-air-quality">check air quality in the office</a>. Additionally, I am trying to learn ObservableHQ to communicate data.</p>

  <title>Explaining QMRA</title>

<p>I had the opportunity of being part of risk assessment that used the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework. As the name already shows, the desire for academic precision creates usability difficulties by non academic.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.giacomobutte.com/blog/idyll/qmra02.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Considering that some very interesting tools exist such as Idyll and curve note that try provide more interactive ways of engaging with the readers, we have set up a 10 minutes explanation of the QMRA framework<sup>1</sup> using Idyll. It is still a draft but maybe is able to communicate the core idea behind the framework. If you have 10 minutes, <a href="https://bttgcm.github.io/QMRA/">take a look</a>. The idea behind the presentation is to give a preliminary understanding of the QMRA process to stakeholders that do not have a technical background.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) is the process of estimating the risk from exposure to microorganisms. The process involves measuring known microbial pathogens or indicators and running a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the risk of transfer. If a dose-response model is available for the microbe, it be used to estimate the probability of infection. QMRA has expanded to be used to estimate microbial risk in many fields, but is particularly important in assessments of food water supply and human faeces/wastewater safety. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_microbiological_risk_assessment">wikipedia</a></p></div><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;An active reader asks questions, considers alternatives, questions assumptions, and even questions the trustworthiness of the author. An active reader tries to generalize specific examples, and devise specific examples for generalities. An active reader doesn’t passively sponge up information, but uses the author’s argument as a springboard for critical thought and deep understanding. <a href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/">From Bret Victor</a></p></div></div><p>Along these ideas it is very interesting to read about the idea of the active reader<sup>2</sup> as Bret Victor defines it.</p>

  <title>Interactive map of violent events</title>

<p>While working in Sudan for ICRC and looking at violents events that happened in the last years I created <a href="https://bttgcm.shinyapps.io/Sudan_Violent_Events/#section-timeseries">this interactive map</a> that allows to get some of the information contained in the <a href="https://acleddata.com">ACLED datasets</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.giacomobutte.com/blog/qmra/journal02.jpg" class="img-fluid"> Very happy to have published with Charles Niwagaba and Annika Nordin an article on the risk assessment of wastewater sludge reuse. What we tried to quantify is the risk that consumer and workers would face while using wastewater sludge as a fertiliser. The numercial models that we built suggest that there is significant risk for both categories but also that other source of microbial contamination exist. We are now working on a policy briefing that will give suggestions on how to better address this issue in Uganda.</p>
