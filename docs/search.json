Between 2000 and 2010 I have studied and worked in design and architecture firms exploring the cultural and socio-economic drivers that shape the built environment. In 2010, after relocating to Cambodia I started working as a consultant and contractor in the development sector. I have designed urban upgrading in informal settlements, small community centres. In Nepal I had the opportunity of being part of the post-earthquake response and reconstruction.\nIn 2018, I took an MSc in Environmental Engineering at Newcastle University to better understand the relationship between the built and the natural environment. I was part of research projects on water quality and environmental risk assessment. This was also a great opportunity to acquire a sharper work methodology and learn new tools for assessment and analysis.\nIn 2020 I have started working in the emergency sector as water, sanitation and habitat project manager. I have worked in Sudan (ICRC), Liberia and Malawi (MSF) mostly on health facilities infrastructure, water supply and emergency response."

    "text": "Semantic network\nIn an article on Water Security(WS) 1 we tried to find a way to compare different definition for the concept and to break down these definitions in parts for comparison. The result is something fairly close to semantic network 2. From the image below one can see for example how the basic meaning is defined differently. looking at L2 and L3 in the image below, it can be observed that the majority of definitions see WS as “access / availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality”. Other definitions frame it using risk concepts and define it as “acceptable risk level / protection from diseases and disasters”. L4 defines the systems that are supported by WS: most mentioned are a health life and ecosystems, followed by economic aspects (livelihood and production). Lastly L5 indicates other limits that should be considered such as sustainability, geographical limitations, costs.\n1 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/18/29072 A semantic network, or frame network is a knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network. This is often used as a form of knowledge representation. It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices, which represent concepts, and edges, which represent semantic relations between concepts,[1] mapping or connecting semantic fields. A semantic network may be instantiated as, for example, a graph database or a concept map. Typical standardized semantic networks are expressed as semantic triples.(Wikipedia)"

    "text": "I had the opportunity of being part of risk assessment that used the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework. As the name already shows, the desire for academic precision creates usability difficulties by non academic.\n\nConsidering that some very interesting tools exist such as Idyll and curve note that try provide more interactive ways of engaging with the readers, we have set up a 10 minutes explanation of the QMRA framework1 using Idyll. It is still a draft but maybe is able to communicate the core idea behind the framework. If you have 10 minutes, take a look. The idea behind the presentation is to give a preliminary understanding of the QMRA process to stakeholders that do not have a technical background.\n1 Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) is the process of estimating the risk from exposure to microorganisms. The process involves measuring known microbial pathogens or indicators and running a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the risk of transfer. If a dose-response model is available for the microbe, it be used to estimate the probability of infection. QMRA has expanded to be used to estimate microbial risk in many fields, but is particularly important in assessments of food water supply and human faeces/wastewater safety. wikipedia2 An active reader asks questions, considers alternatives, questions assumptions, and even questions the trustworthiness of the author. An active reader tries to generalize specific examples, and devise specific examples for generalities. An active reader doesn’t passively sponge up information, but uses the author’s argument as a springboard for critical thought and deep understanding. From Bret VictorAlong these ideas it is very interesting to read about the idea of the active reader2 as Bret Victor defines it."

As shown below, the model was suggesting papers with a 30% relevance ( around 3 paper over 10).\n\nThe relevant papers (33 then reduced to 30 due to duplication) were then exported.Since this is a manageable number we move to the analysis phase.

    "text": "When working at Newcastle University on Water Security, I felt the complexity of that concept could be reduced to a simpler form taking inspiration from system diagrams. The idea was to place 3 elements at the center of the diagram. Nature(N), Population (P) mediated by infrastructure (I). Additionally these 3 elements would have close relation to enabling factors such as governance (G) and resources (R). This part of the diagram represent the system at a local level. This can be thought as a region, village, basin, it would depend on local conditions.\nThis “local system” would then have external stressors such as climate change (CC), political change (PL), growth (GU) and economic changes (EC).\n\nWhat is perhaps more interesting is that the relation between these nodes can describe particular situations. For example, nature-population (N-P) represent natural hazards on one way and human threat to the natural environment. Resources given to infrastructure is described by R-I. User behaviours between population and infrastructure (P-I).\n\nTo test the diagram, I associated the Sustainable Development Goals with each section of the diagram:\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{butte2024,\n  author = {Butte, Giacomo},\n  title = {Water {Security} as a Diagram},\n  date = {2024-04-11},\n  url = {https://www.giacomobutte.com/blog/water_security},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nButte, Giacomo. 2024. “Water Security as a Diagram.” April\n11, 2024. https://www.giacomobutte.com/blog/water_security."
