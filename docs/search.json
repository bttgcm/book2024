The result is something fairly close to semantic network 2. From the image below one can see for example how the basic meaning is defined differently. looking at L2 and L3 in the image below, it can be observed that the majority of definitions see WS as “access / availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality”. Other definitions frame it using risk concepts and define it as “acceptable risk level / protection from diseases and disasters”. L4 defines the systems that are supported by WS: most mentioned are a health life and ecosystems, followed by economic aspects (livelihood and production). Lastly L5 indicates other limits that should be considered such as sustainability, geographical limitations, costs.\n1 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/18/29072 A semantic network, or frame network is a knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network. This is often used as a form of knowledge representation. It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices, which represent concepts, and edges, which represent semantic relations between concepts,[1] mapping or connecting semantic fields. A semantic network may be instantiated as, for example, a graph database or a concept map. Typical standardized semantic networks are expressed as semantic triples.(Wikipedia)"

    "text": "I had the opportunity of being part of risk assessment that used the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework. As the name already shows, the desire for academic precision creates usability difficulties by non academic.\n\nConsidering that some very interesting tools exist such as Idyll and curve note that try provide more interactive ways of engaging with the readers, we have set up a 10 minutes explanation of the QMRA framework1 using Idyll. It is still a draft but maybe is able to communicate the core idea behind the framework. If you have 10 minutes, take a look. The idea behind the presentation is to give a preliminary understanding of the QMRA process to stakeholders that do not have a technical background.\n1 Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) is the process of estimating the risk from exposure to microorganisms. The process involves measuring known microbial pathogens or indicators and running a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the risk of transfer. If a dose-response model is available for the microbe, it be used to estimate the probability of infection. QMRA has expanded to be used to estimate microbial risk in many fields, but is particularly important in assessments of food water supply and human faeces/wastewater safety. wikipedia2 An active reader asks questions, considers alternatives, questions assumptions, and even questions the trustworthiness of the author. An active reader tries to generalize specific examples, and devise specific examples for generalities. An active reader doesn’t passively sponge up information, but uses the author’s argument as a springboard for critical thought and deep understanding. From Bret VictorAlong these ideas it is very interesting to read about the idea of the active reader2 as Bret Victor defines it."

At first, article were manually screened. Using the terms “nosocomial AND design” 5 articles out of the 8 proposed were marked as relevant.\nThen ASReview started the active learn process on the 1825 papers3 using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes, clustering and dynamic resampling as options.\nThe model then proposed different papers to be reviewed for relevance. )0 articles were reviewed with 33 found to be relevant. As shown below, the model was suggesting papers with a 30% relevance ( around 3 paper over 10).\n\nThe relevant papers (33 then reduced to 30 due to duplication) were then exported.Since this is a manageable number we move to the analysis phase. Another option would be to use this bibliography and repeat from step 3.\n\n2 ASReview, developed at Utrecht University, helps scholars and practitioners to get an overview of the most relevant records for their work.3 see the website for more explanation\n\n\n\nA first analysis was done to create word-cloud from the titles of the relevant bibliography, see margin column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNGRAM\n\n\n\nN-Grams\nVOS Viewer\n\n\n\n\nAfter this first round, and by inspecting the most relevant articles a new set of keywords can be proposed:\nFacility Design environmental contamination healthcare nosocomial\n\n\n\nhttps://estech.shinyapps.io/citationchaser/"

    "text": "Very happy to have published with Charles Niwagaba and Annika Nordin an article on the risk assessment of wastewater sludge reuse. What we tried to quantify is the risk that consumer and workers would face while using wastewater sludge as a fertiliser. The numercial models that we built suggest that there is significant risk for both categories but also that other source of microbial contamination exist. We are now working on a policy briefing that will give suggestions on how to better address this issue in Uganda.\nRead the full article or listen to an episode of Paper to Practice."

    "text": "When working at Newcastle University on Water Security, I felt the complexity of that concept could be reduced to a simpler form taking inspiration from system diagrams. The idea was to place 3 elements at the center of the diagram. Nature(N), Population (P) mediated by infrastructure (I). Additionally these 3 elements would have close relation to enabling factors such as governance (G) and resources (R). This part of the diagram represent the system at a local level. This can be thought as a region, village, basin, it would depend on local conditions.\nThis “local system” would then have external stressors such as climate change (CC), political change (PL), growth (GU) and economic changes (EC).\n\nWhat is perhaps more interesting is that the relation between these nodes can describe particular situations. For example, nature-population (N-P) represent natural hazards on one way and human threat to the natural environment. Resources given to infrastructure is described by R-I. User behaviours between population and infrastructure (P-I).\n\nTo test the diagram, I associated the Sustainable Development Goals with each section of the diagram:\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{butte2024,\n  author = {Butte, Giacomo},\n  title = {Water {Security} as a Diagram},\n  date = {2024-04-11},\n  url = {https://www.giacomobutte.com/blog/water_security/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nButte, Giacomo. 2024. “Water Security as a Diagram.” April\n11, 2024. https://www.giacomobutte.com/blog/water_security/."

A plot of the collected data in the a two month period. During this period the whirly birds where sealed for 6 days to see if they had any impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA plot of the difference in temperature between ceiling and outside is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following plot shows the relation of temperature difference versus outdoor temperature. We can observe two modes: with and without sunlight radiation. Up to sunrise, difference is negative while when sun radiation starts to heat the roof the relationship changes and temperature difference reaches positive values (attic warmer than outside). The data collected did not record the amount of haze and therefore the intensity of sun radiation that could be one of the factor (with Relative humidity) that generates variability. Adding a smooth curve shows another difference, above 34 C the whirly birds start to show a statistically significant difference in their impact on temperature difference but in the opposite direction as expected.\nWe should keep in mind that the closure of the whirly birds was done only for 1 week and that sun radiation, affected by cloudiness for example, was not recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen above, the effect of the whirly birds changes across the day and across temperatures. below a plot over the 24h and over working hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour regression models were run: \\[M1: T_{diff} = \\alpha + \\beta T_{ext}\\] \\[M2: T_{diff} = \\alpha + \\beta T_{ext}+ WB\\] \\[M3: T_{diff} = \\alpha + \\beta T_{ext_{8-17h}}\\] \\[M4: T_{diff} = \\alpha + \\beta T_{ext_{8-17h}}+WB\\]\nTwo model only regressing the difference between ceiling and outdoor temperature on outdoor temperature (M1, M3) and two having whirly bird treatment (with values 1 and 0 for open and close) on models M2 and M4. Additionally model M3 and M4 have used only temperature between 7am and 5pm. Result show a negative impact on temperature difference (less difference) across the recorded values (-0.15) and even more in the 7am 5pm range (-0.34). In both case the result are not statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\n*M1\nM2\nM3\nM4\n\n\nBeta\n95% CI1\np-value\nBeta\n95% CI1\np-value\nBeta\n95% CI1\np-value\nBeta\n95% CI1\np-value\n\n\n\n\noutside\n0.71\n0.69, 0.73\n&lt;0.001\n0.71\n0.69, 0.73\n&lt;0.001\n0.72\n0.67, 0.76\n&lt;0.001\n0.71\n0.66, 0.75\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nwb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.16\n-0.07, 0.39\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.34\n-0.70, 0.02\n0.063\n\n\n\n1 CI = Confidence Interval"

The data may not be capturing sigmificant other factors such as sun radiance, humidity, wind. interestingly up to 34 C the whirly birds have a positive impact but this reverses at 36. it hsould also be considered that maybe the wrapped whirly birds may act as heat collector and therefore contributing to the overl warming of the roof-attic.\nFurther data should be collected, perhaps adding more information on the sky condition, humidity, wind. Analysis should be run again with thenew gathered data."
