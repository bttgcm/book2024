    "text": "Past\nI have spent the last 20 years by studying and working on different aspects of the relationship between human society, the built and the natural environment. Between 2000 and 2010 I have studied and worked in design and architecture firms exploring the cultural and socio-economic drivers that shape the built environment. In 2010, after relocating to Cambodia I started working as a consultant and contractor in the development sector. I have designed urban upgrading in informal settlements, small community centres. In Nepal I had the opportunity of being part of the post-earthquake response and reconstruction.\nIn 2018, I took an MSc in Environmental Engineering at Newcastle University to better understand the relationship between the built and the natural environment. I was part of research projects on water quality and environmental risk assessment. This was also a great opportunity to acquire a sharper work methodology and learn new tools for assessment and analysis.\nIn 2020 I have started working in the emergency sector as water, sanitation and habitat project manager. I have worked in Sudan (ICRC), Liberia and Malawi (MSF) mostly on health facilities infrastructure, water supply and emergency response."

    "text": "I had the opportunity of being part of risk assessment that used the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework. As the name already shows, the desire for academic precision creates usability difficulties by non academic.\n\nConsidering that some very interesting tools exist such as Idyll and curve note that try provide more interactive ways of engaging with the readers, we have set up a 10 minutes explanation of the QMRA framework1 using Idyll. It is still a draft but maybe is able to communicate the core idea behind the framework. If you have 10 minutes, take a look. The idea behind the presentation is to give a preliminary understanding of the QMRA process to stakeholders that do not have a technical background.\n1 Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) is the process of estimating the risk from exposure to microorganisms. The process involves measuring known microbial pathogens or indicators and running a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the risk of transfer. If a dose-response model is available for the microbe, it be used to estimate the probability of infection. QMRA has expanded to be used to estimate microbial risk in many fields, but is particularly important in assessments of food water supply and human faeces/wastewater safety. wikipedia2 An active reader asks questions, considers alternatives, questions assumptions, and even questions the trustworthiness of the author. An active reader tries to generalize specific examples, and devise specific examples for generalities. An active reader doesn’t passively sponge up information, but uses the author’s argument as a springboard for critical thought and deep understanding. From Bret VictorAlong these ideas it is very interesting to read about the idea of the active reader2 as Bret Victor defines it."
